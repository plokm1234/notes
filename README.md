# Having fun with the command prompt

Create, remove, list, and read a note with the command prompt

example: 

node app.js create --title "test1" --body "test"

This will create a file with the content as [{title: "test1", body:"test"}], and the file will save in the same directory of app.js and has a filename "notes.json".
